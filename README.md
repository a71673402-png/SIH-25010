## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Problem Creater's Organization
Government of Punjab

## Theme
Agriculture, FoodTech & Rural Development

## Proposed Solution
Personalized advice on crops, pests, and fertilizers

Voice + text interface in local languages

Works offline or with poor internet

Photo-based pest diagnosis (optional)

Weather, soil, and crop-based recommendations

Access to mandi prices, govt. schemes, and input dealers

IVR and WhatsApp options for low-tech users

Support via FPOs and agri-workers

## Technical Approach

Android app, IVR, and WhatsApp for easy farmer access

Supports voice and text in local languages

AI gives crop, pest, and fertilizer advice using soil and weather data

Uses satellite data for crop stage and pest alerts

Farmers can upload photos for pest/disease diagnosis

Sends alerts via SMS, WhatsApp, or IVR calls

Stores user data securely on the cloud

Connects to govt. data (soil cards, mandi prices, schemes)

Works offline or with low internet

Fully scalable, secure, and privacy-compliant

## Feasibility and Viability
High smartphone and mobile penetration in rural India

Farmers already use WhatsApp and voice calls daily

IVR and local language support reduce digital literacy barriers

Uses existing government and satellite data (low cost)

Modular tech stack ensures low development and maintenance cost

Partnerships with FPOs, NGOs, and agri-input firms aid outreach

Freemium model ensures accessibility and potential revenue

CSR, government grants, and agri-tech funding can support scale

Strong demand for advisory services among small farmers

Solution aligns with national goals (Digital India, Doubling Farmers' Income)

## Impact and Benefits
Improved crop yield through timely, personalized advice

Reduced input costs by avoiding overuse of chemicals

Better pest and disease control with photo-based diagnosis

Increased profits for small and marginal farmers

Lower environmental damage from optimized input use

Easy access to govt. schemes and mandi prices

Builds farmer confidence in digital solutions

Promotes sustainable and data-driven farming practices

Saves time and effort with simple, local-language guidance

Bridges the digital divide in rural agriculture
